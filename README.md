This is Team 3's final project for the ASU CPI 211 Game Development class, where we had 7 weeks to create a 3D game

In that timespan, we created Goblin Dash!

In a village filled with the Vegan Knights, you play a daring goblin that delivers fast food to all who long for it. Twist and turn around the guards, dashing and jumping to outmaneuver them all and get the greasy food to the people!

Below are some links regarding the game, including a link to the Itch page to play this game!
